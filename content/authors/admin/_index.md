      Supervised by [Prof. Joaqu√≠n Rodr√≠guez-L√≥pez](https://rodriguezlopez.chemistry.illinois.edu/), I'm working on automated, high-throughput electrochemical characterization of energy storage materials for redox-flow batteries and beyond. I combine electrochemical methods, automation, micro- and nano-fabrication, finite-element analysis, and data science in my research works.

    summary: |
      I earned my BSc degree in materials science and engineering with high honor. I also held a declared minor in electrical engineering. My focus area was microelectronics and electronic properties of semiconducting materials.

      I joined the research group of [Prof. Yingjie Zhang](https://zhang.matse.illinois.edu/) as an undergraduate researcher in the summer of 2021. I worked on developing an encoder-decoder convolutional neural network for nanoscale surface profiling with enhanced precision. This work has been published in [Nano Letters](https://doi.org/10.1021/acs.nanolett.3c04712) and was selected as the journal cover. This experience offered me much more than a publication, but my interest in research, and was part of the reason why I decided to pursue a Ph.D. degree. I not only learned the principle of convolutional neural network, which is something I had very little experience with when I started the project, but also managed to apply the knowledge to tackle scientific problems.
