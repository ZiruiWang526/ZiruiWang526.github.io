abstract: |
  Mediated electron transfer serves as the working principle of redox-targeting flow batteries (RTFBs), a promising technology that requires optimization across a vast parameter space, including different energy storage materials, redox mediators, and electrolyte conditions. The method of electrochemical surface interrogation scanning electrochemical microscopy (SI-SECM) has been developed to understand the mediated electron transfer process between a redox mediator and a surface-confined species. However, this technique is often labor-intensive, low-throughput, and incompatible with automation and thus limits its applications for systematic studies such as optimizing RTFBs.

  Here, we present an automated platform based on interdigitated electrode arrays (IDAs) that enables high-throughput redox-titration measurements. Leveraging Python libraries developed by our group, we seamlessly interface electrochemical workstations and hardware components such as a syringe pump, achieving full automation of tasks traditionally requiring human intervention.

  To demonstrate the capability of our platform, we performed automated redox-titration measurements on polypyrrole (PPy), a conductive polymer that has found uses in pseudocapacitors. A total number of 504 SI measurements were conducted in 50 hours, covering a broad parameter space that included different IDA electrode gap widths, PPy charging potential, voltammetric scan rates, and electrolyte concentrations, with hexaammineruthenium(III) (Ru(NH3)63+) as the redox mediator. Our results demonstrated high reproducibility and revealed the effects of charging potential and electrolyte concentration on the charge storage behavior of PPy. Finite-element simulations further provided insights into the charge transfer kinetics between PPy and the redox mediator.

  We then extended the use of our platform to Prussian blue analogues (PBAs), a promising material for RTFBs to perform automated redox targeting experiments with different electrolytes and redox mediators. The high-throughput, programmable, and versatile nature of our platform establishes a practical way for advanced investigations into systems that require large-scale combinatorial studies.
