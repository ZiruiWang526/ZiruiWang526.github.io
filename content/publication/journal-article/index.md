  Surface topography, or height profile, is a critical property for various micro- and nanostructured materials and devices, as well as biological systems. At the nanoscale, atomic force microscopy (AFM) is the tool of choice for surface profiling due to its capability to noninvasively map the topography of almost all types of samples. However, this method suffers from one drawback: the convolution of the nanoprobe’s shape in the height profile of the samples, which is especially severe for sharp protrusion features. Here, we report a deep learning (DL) approach to overcome this limit. Adopting an image-to-image translation methodology, we use data sets of tip-convoluted and deconvoluted image pairs to train an encoder–decoder based deep convolutional neural network. The trained network successfully removes the tip convolution from AFM topographic images of various nanocorrugated surfaces and recovers the true, precise 3D height profiles of these samples.

abstract: |
  Automated, rapid electrocatalyst discovery techniques that comprehensively address the exploration of chemical spaces, characterization of catalyst robustness, reproducibility, and translation of results to (flow) electrolysis operation are needed. Responding to the growing interest in biomass valorization, we studied the glycerol electro-oxidation reaction (GEOR) on gold in alkaline media as a model reaction to demonstrate the efficacy of such methodology introduced here. Our platform combines individually addressable electrode arrays with HardPotato, a Python application programming interface for potentiostat control, to automate electrochemical experiments and data analysis operations. We systematically investigated the effects of reduction potential (El) and pulse width (PW) on GEOR activity during the electrodeposition (Edep) of gold, evaluating 28 different conditions in triplicate measurements with great versatility. Our findings reveal a direct correlation between El and GEOR activity. Upon CV cycling, we recorded a 52% increase in peak current density and a −0.25 V shift in peak potential as El varied from −0.2 to −1.4 V. We also identified an optimal PW of ∼1.0 s, yielding maximum catalytic performance. The swift analysis enabled by our methodology allowed us to correlate performance enhancements with increased electrochemical surface area and preferential deposition of Au(110) and Au(111) sites, even in disparate Edep conditions. We validate our methodology by scaling the Edep process to larger electrodes and correlating intrinsic activity with product speciation via flow electrolysis measurements. Our platform highlights opportunities in automation for electrocatalyst discovery to address pressing needs toward industrial decarbonization, such as biomass valorization.
